Cloud Architecture is the same as the above on-premises architecture, but it takes care of the physical infrastructure by providing it with built-in security and redundancy at a large scale.

In addition, the **management plane** relates to the management and control of the cloud infrastructure and services, with key functions like monitoring, resource provisioning/allocation, configuration, security controls, troubleshooting, etc.

### Types of Cloud Services

**Workload level** - *Software as a Service (SaaS)*

- **SaaS** - software applications are delivered over the internet as a service (e.g. Google Tools, Microsoft365, etc).

**Services level** - *Platform as a Service (PaaS)*

- **PaaS** - provides a complete runtime environment for developers to build, deploy and manage applications. 

**Virtual Machine level** - *Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)*

- **IaaS** - virtualized computing resources (virtual machines, storage, networking components) are provided by the cloud provider to users over the internet as a service.

These Cloud services types support levels of customization and can also offer a range of distinct "*as a Service*" options.

When moving from IaaS to SaaS, *ease of administration* increases and *control* is reduced, and vice versa.

### Why Cloud

The key advantages of choosing cloud computing are:

- Scalability - easily adjust resources based on demand.
  - capacity-based spending

- **Cost** Efficiency - pay only for what you use, no upfront investment.
  - **consumption-based spending** (functions, services, storage)

- Accessibility and Flexibility - access applications and data from anywhere.
- Reliability and **Availability** - high uptime and built-in redundancy.
  - minimized administrative overhead

- Data **Security** and Compliance - robust security measures and regulatory compliance.
- Disaster Recovery and Backup - automated backup and quick recovery options.
- Collaboration and Productivity - real-time collaboration and increased efficiency.
- Innovation and Agility - rapid adoption of new technologies and services.
- Green and Sustainable Computing - energy-efficient infrastructure.
- Continuous Updates and Maintenance - provider handles maintenance and updates.

> 🔗 [CapEx vs OpEx in Cloud Computing](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/capex-vs-opex)
>

**CapEx** (Capital expenditure) - `e.g.` on-premises capacity expansion/reduction

- hardware and licensing, replace/sell equipment

**OpEx** (Operating expenses) - `e.g.` cloud-based capacity expansion/reduction

- pay for what is used, no hardware purchase
- reduce monthly cost, no upfront capital costs

*Moving to the cloud might not be a good idea in case of ongoing operational investments, regulatory compliance and data fencing.*

**Billing**, **Monitoring**, **Optimization**

There are different billing **entities** (what is being billed), with a billing **cycle** that is generally a month. Optimize billing **rate** with billing **management** tools.

**Budgets** and **alerts** are useful for monitoring.

**Agents** (Azure advisors, Google recommenders, AWS cost anomaly detection) monitor the cloud patterns and make recommendations for cost-cutting, **sizing** and **autoscale** strategies. *Serverless* options and long-term commitments (discounts, etc) can be useful too.

### Support

Cloud **resource responsibility** refers to the distribution of responsibilities between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the cloud customer regarding the management and maintenance of various aspects of the cloud environment.

- The specific responsibilities allocated to each party can vary based on the cloud service model being used (`e.g.` IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) - shared responsibility model.
  - CSP - infrastructure, data centers, networking, physical security, hardware maintenance
  - Customer - resources and services management and configuration (data plane)

![Defending the Whole, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS from Mark Nunnikhoven](cloud-foundationsassets/image-20230527114523623.png)

In terms of **SLA**s (**S**ervice **L**evel **A**greements), the customer can be responsible for the workload and services that are running. *The **SLA** is a contractual agreement between a service provider and a customer that defines the expected level of service and the metrics by which that service will be measured.*

### Scalability & Availability

![GCP Global Locations](cloud-foundationsassets/regions.png)

Cloud **regional computing** refers to the deployment of cloud computing resources within a specific geographic region.

Cloud service providers typically have **multiple data centers** located in different regions around the world, and regional computing allows users to deploy and access their cloud resources in specific geographic areas/**availability zones**.

- `e.g.` - [Google Cloud Global Locations](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/)

**Availability** refers to the measure of how accessible and operational cloud services and resources are to users (load balancing, disaster recovery, redundancy, failover). 

**Cloud scale** refers to the ability of cloud computing systems to handle large-scale workloads and accommodate rapid growth and demand. It refers to the capacity and capability of cloud infrastructure to scale resources, such as computing power, storage and network bandwidth, in response to varying workloads and user demands, also minimizing costs by **auto-scaling**.

- `e.g.` - [Google Cloud Load balancing and Scaling](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling)
