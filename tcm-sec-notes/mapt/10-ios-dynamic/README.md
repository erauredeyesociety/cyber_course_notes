## Jailbreaking

> ❗ Use Jailbreaking with caution! Jailbreaking is legal in the US but may have legal implications in other countries.

> 🔗 [iOS CFW Guide](https://ios.cfw.guide/)

[**Jailbreaking**](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/unauthorized-modification-of-ios-iph9385bb26a/ios) is the process of unlocking an iOS device to customize its functionality beyond Apple's restrictions, enabling the installation of custom apps and tweaks for a personalized user experience.

- iOS prioritizes security and reliability with built-in protections against malware, viruses, but jailbreaking can compromise these safeguards, leading to security risks, instability, and reduced battery life
- Jailbreaking iOS is necessary to conduct full iOS penetration testing
- [Types of jailbreak](https://ios.cfw.guide/types-of-jailbreak/)

> 📌 Follow my [iOS Jailbreak Guide](https://blog.syselement.com/home/cyber-everything/mobile/labs/ios-jailbreak) and make sure you always check for updated commands/guides before step into jailbreaking.
