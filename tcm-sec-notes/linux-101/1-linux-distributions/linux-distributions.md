# Linux Distributions

## What is Linux?

- Linux is an open source Operating System (O.S.)
  - Can be downloaded for free
  - Wide variety of distributions
- An OS manages resources such as CPU time, memory, storage space, etc.
- Linux is, *at its most basic*, just the Kernel of the OS
  - the always running core at the lowest level of the operating system

## What is a Linux Distribution?

- A **Linux *distro*** is the Linux kernel combined with all the software necessary for an OS, like:
  - desktop environment (GUI)
  - applications
  - package managers
  - philosophy and goals of the distro developers
- Other operating systems are similar to Linux (e.g. Mac OS)
